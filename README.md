# Job Quest Tracker

## Background
I was looking for a new job and I participated in many recruitment processes. Keeping notes regarding the role and all details started to be a challange. I used simple txt file but it started to be longer and longer and my convention of writing the most important information begun to be unmanagable 

## Business idea
Write an app to keep track of all recrutment process

## Tech idea
Levrage the AI app to generate design and try to reuse it in the React on Front-End
Check how ChatGPT can help me with writing .NET code

## Extra:
There will be a chrome plugin that can scrap DM from LinkedId
